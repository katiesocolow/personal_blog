<div id="what-am-i-up-to" class="section level2">
<h2>What am I up to?</h2>
<p>I guess it’s time to just casually put this out there but….I’ve been living in Cape Town, South Africa for the last 5 weeks! I’m studying abroad here on a program called iXperience. For the first four weeks, I took a class on Data Science and learned about programming in R and Python. I made linear regression models, decision trees, neural networks, and spent countless hours trying to rangle data. BUT I have definitely had ample time to do OTHER more INTERESTING thigns as well. SO now I’m going to use this as a recap tool for myself to remember all of the amazing experiences I’ve had while being here</p>
<ul>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>Hiking
<ul>
<li>I’ve hiked Lions Head, TWICE now! Being from New York, I’m not much of an outdoorsy person or a nature gal by ANY means but I did really enjoy hiking Lions Head. The first time I did a sunrise hike at 6:30am. The difficulty increased tremendously and although native cape tonians would argue that it’s the “easiest” of the hikes, I would strongly disagree. That hike was BY NO MEANS easy but the view truly was spectacular.</li>
