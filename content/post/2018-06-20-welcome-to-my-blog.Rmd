HELLO WORLD! 

My name is Katie Socolow and I am a rising third year at the University of Virginia. I'm studying mathematical statistics and as a personal goal, I've decided to practice my newly acquired R programming skills by crafting a personal blog. So bear with me, I've got a long way to go and SO much to learn, but I'm going to make the best of it. 

I haven't quite decided yet what I want to make of this blog but my plan is to craft it along the way. Maybe it'll be mostly about food, as I'm probably the biggest foodie you'll ever meet. Maybe it'll be focused on sports analytics, my ideal career path (at the moment), and showcase all of my personal and coding exploration within the field. Maybe it will just be about how my day was and my take on the world. Who knows? Hopefully you'll stick with me and find out.

But before you make any decisions about your dedication to the words on your screen that have pretty much just flowed out filterless....you're probably wondering about me. Who am I? What a horrible question to be asked and to ask yourself. So broad, daunting and overwhelming. Yet so crucial to understand.
